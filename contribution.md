# Contribution Guide (If you care)
## Commits
Make sure to make your commits with a couple changes each.
Don't forget to describe said changes with a relatively-descriptive commit message.
## Pull Requests
Any pull requests are welcome, as long as no Rust, or other Esoteric languages are included in the code, and they include a feature that actually matters.
## Notes
Any pushes directly to master will be rejected due to branch protection rules, which is why you might see in the git commit history that this file was on a separate branch for a bit.<br>
All commits should be made on a separate local branch, pushed onto the main repo, and a pull request you should make a pull request describing your changes (unless they're self explanatory because of the branch name).<br>
Please don't add backdoors to the kernel or other parts of the OS.
